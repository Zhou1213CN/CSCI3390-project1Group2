A easy way to estimate the number of trials to have 7 leading zeroes in a SHA256 ouput would be::

1.If we are getting 0000000fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff,
we could get it divided by ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff, the maximum value of a 256-bit number. 

2.So if we are going to hit the 256 bit number with one trial, the probability that we are getting 7 zeroes in a row will be $\frac{1}{16^{7}}$ We can then get the trials number that are required by $16^{7}$, which is 268,435,477 which is approximately 2 and a half billion times of trial. 



## Question 3

```scala
//Original Line
iter.map(x => rand.nextInt(Int.MaxValue - 1) + 1)

//Revised Line
iter.map(x => rand.nextInt(trials) + 1)

```
