## Question 2

k = 7

xS = 1749757147this_is_a_bitcoin_block_of_66118645_and_25117738

Hash value = 0000000e401e631dabe5b5e7131350ffa44f7a9a786c73f0203d4cf83a2965ec

number of trials = 200,000,000

Time elapsed = 790s

Machine typeï¼š n1-standard-4

A easy way to estimate the number of trials to have 7 leading zeroes in a SHA256 ouput would be::

1.If we are getting 0000000fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff,
we could get it divided by ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff, the maximum value of a 256-bit number. 

2.So if we are going to hit the 256 bit number with one trial, the probability that we are getting 7 zeroes in a row will be 1/(16^7)

We can then get the trials number that are required by 16^7, which is 268,435,477 which is approximately 2 and a half billion times of trial. 



## Question 3

```scala
//Original Line
iter.map(x => rand.nextInt(Int.MaxValue - 1) + 1)

//Revised Line
iter.map(x => rand.nextInt(trials) + 1)

```

To get the xS value that we need, the computer needs to continously change the value of Nonce. When we generate Nonce from 1,...N instead of 1,... maxvalue, the possibility of getting the Nonce we need decreases significantly because the numbers of trials are much fewer than maxvalue, i.e. 2147483647. As a result, the original randomized approach is more efficient.
